## Base information

Fluence is a tool for easier integration with different blockchains. You may migrate part of your exists application to the blockchain or build a brand new blockchain application using Fluence SDK.
Fluence is available in two configurations:
1. A pre-installed solution which may be used by multiple customers
2. An on-premise solution which may be configured and deployed on your own private server

Fluence already integrated with most popular blockchains: Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin. Also, it will be integrated with HyperLedger Fabric, BitShares (Graphene) and Stellar in the nearest time.

If you want to deploy your own blockchain, for private usage, than Fluence can easily be integrated with that. Also, Fluence provides a single interface for work with all blockchains via SDK or API, so if you want to use more than one blockchain in a single app, then it’s not a big deal.
